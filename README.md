# mk-files

An assortment of Makefile fragments that I'll be adding to as I grow my collection. Not that many people know this because it was written before reddit even existed, but `make` is actually one of the few pieces of good software that's ever been written.

Unix philosophy is sometimes expressed as "do one thing, and do it good", but actually `make` can do just about anything. If you want to learn more about `make`, I highly recommend you do that.

You can include these fragments in your own Makefile (or in your Christmas cards or your email signature) by writing `include <fragment-name>.mk`.
